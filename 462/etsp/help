what is the input ? 
how does it get input ? 
redirected to std in
exact format of the data
first line contains an integer containing the number of points,
points are a pair of floats
then come the points
write a program that reads in the number o points alloc space 
data
management
what it is 
int n
distances between points
p 	n points 	dist
2 points per dist * n^2 
array elements 1-n
2 arrays for x and y
we're discussing.
tss i love that stuff
precalc e the distaance s between the points 
how to do that 
how to store that
3 element array 
n 	n 	dist
n	x	dist	
n	f	dist
after you precalculate the distances, forget the points 
so now i have the distances and i am happy 
after we precalc all the distances 
n=5
ask the system for 
an array of x and y 
5 thingies
for (i = 1; i < n; i++)
{
	x[i]=x;
	y[i]=y;
}
for (i = 1; i < n; i++)
{
	for (j = 1; j < n; j++)
	{
		printf("%f",array[i][j];
	}
}
for (i = 1 ; i < n; i ++)
i know that i have an array x[1-n] y[1-n]
dist formula
