CS 364                                                           Spring 97

                        DUE ________________.


                            Assignment Next

Write a C program that merges an arbitrary number of files of runs

/* what is in the files? */

into a large sorted file.  You may assume that the only files in the 

/* sorted numerically */

current working directory are the ones to be merged and the executable
image of the merging program.

You will not know how many files there are until the program is
called; that's your first problem.  
			/* fine */ 
					This *program merges* the files
without resorting to a shell script.  ALL files are managed by the C
program.  (See ~kbg/364/C/system.c for a possible method.)  Use a
knock-out tree (ie. a heap) to find the minimum of a collection of

/* what is a ko tree? */

values.  Don't leave the current directory cluttered w/ unwanted
intermediate files.
/* ok */

Issues

  Find FOPEN_MAX -- but not all can be used by the program. Why?

  Array of FILE pointers. Why? (or a struct where one component is a
    file pointer...)

Test your program by using the rand / splitter programs to make input files.
Use your first merging program to check the output.
