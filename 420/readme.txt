 Research in Software Construction Methods.

 Dr. Keith Gallagher, Computer Science Dept.

 Readings or other work:

 Assigned readings on software construction methods (from the
   instructor's journal collection).

 Description of the study:
 
 There many methods of software development: clean-room, iterative
enhancement, rapid prototyping, and decomposition-based, to list a
few.  The student will survey the methods and select 4 or 5 to "try
out" in a sample implementation.  This will provide a framework for
comparison and analysis from a personal perspective.
