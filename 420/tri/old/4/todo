1. make sure all command line entries are digits
2. make sure digits are a triangle
        ie. the sum of two sides is greater than the third
3. make sure that digits don't exceed boundaries

#define INT_MIN         (-2147483647-1)
#define INT_MAX         2147483647

4. write atoi -> check MAX_INT; reject negatives
