PROJECT PLAN:

I would like to pursue the implementation of the 'slip' protocol.
My plans include the following:
	1. Talk to students who have worked on this project.
	2. Analyze existing 'slip' software.
	3. Ask John Mulvey (in information services) to provide some 
		IP addresses that I can assign to slip clients.
	4. Decide which machine(s) that 'slip' will be implemented on.
