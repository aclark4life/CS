CS 262 Programming and Data Structures (4.00 cr.)
Prerequisite: CS 202. A continuation of CS 202 includ- ing elementary file handling and abstract data types such as lists, stacks, queues, and trees. More advanced formal methods and algorithm analysis. Uses the C/ C++ programming language.

## 295

CS 295 Discrete Structures (3.00 cr.)
Boolean algebra, combinatorics, graphs, inductive and deductive proofs, functions and relations, recurrences, finite state machines. Same course as MA 295.

### Computer Science Research 3.0 credits.

- Research in Software Construction Methods.
- Dr. Keith Gallagher, Computer Science Dept.

### Readings or other work

Assigned readings on software construction methods (from the instructor's journal collection).

### Description of the study
 
There many methods of software development: clean-room, iterative enhancement, rapid prototyping, and decomposition-based, to list a few.  The student will survey the methods and select 4 or 5 to "try out" in a sample implementation.  This will provide a framework for comparison and analysis from a personal perspective.
