sorry man, i forgot to mail you with a plan...

i am still working with mulvey and it is going pretty good. i am doing a 
variety of things the most prominent of which are as follows.

        writing a web tool which allow easy administration of the bootp table. 

                -the bootp protocol allows a machine to receive an i.p. address from
                 a server running on another machine

                -this will involve coding in perl, and html. the html will
                 call a perl script which edit the bootp table (a text file
                 which is in /etc/  

        i have installed two web servers on mulvey's sparc 5 and i also plan to
                install gcc, perl, and elm.

        DHCP
                i have observed the operation of a DHCP server running on an NT box
                and i will be giving a demo of this in class on tues.



        i am going to summarize all of this and display it on a series of web pages
        for the demo!  

        see you tues.
