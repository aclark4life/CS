				*Netscape Enterprise Web Server*

* I downloaded this webserver from Netscape's site: http://netscape.com

* This allows those with minimal UNIX knowledge to administrate
  a webserver.

* All administrative tasks are done from within Netscape.

* I didn't particularly care for this server as I would rather maintain
  my server by editing text files in vi.
