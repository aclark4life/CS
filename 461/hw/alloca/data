here's the program with alloca running a few times:

sanity:~/461>time alloca
0.33u 0.04s 0:00.42 88.0%
sanity:~/461>time alloca
0.35u 0.04s 0:00.39 100.0%
sanity:~/461>time alloca
0.35u 0.04s 0:00.45 86.6%
sanity:~/461>
 
here's the program with malloc running a few times:

sanity:~/461>time malloc
3.32u 1.70s 0:06.20 80.9%
sanity:~/461>time malloc
3.30u 1.51s 0:05.26 91.4%
sanity:~/461>time malloc
3.14u 1.70s 0:05.12 94.5%

hmmm... looks like alloca is a LOT faster...
